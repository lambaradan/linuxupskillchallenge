TITLE: Linux upskill challenge

A month-long challenge for anyone wanting to build Linux sysadmin skills - http://linuxupskillchallenge.org

Starting the first Monday of the month, daily lessons will appear in the sub-reddit r/linuxupskillchallenge - which will also be used for support/discussion. This is a "rolling" course, restarted each month.

Does require some commitment - but if gaining/growing these skills is important to you, then you now have no excuse!
