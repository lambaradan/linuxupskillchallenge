TITLE: A month-long challenge for anyone wanting to build Linux sysadmin skills

The http://linuxupskillchallenge.org Linux commandline/sysadmin "challenge" course starts again soon on the first Monday of next month.

Daily lessons will appear in the sub-reddit r/linuxupskillchallenge - which will also be used for support/discussion. This is a "rolling" course, restarted each month.

Does require some commitment - but if gaining/growing these skills is important to you, then you now have no excuse! 

Requires a (free or cheap) remote server, so it's nice to get that sorted now if you - or some of your staff or friends - are keen.
